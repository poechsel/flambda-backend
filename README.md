The Flambda backend project for OCaml.

## One-time setup for dev work or installation

Only currently tested on Linux/x86-64 and macOS/x86-64.

One-time setup:
```
$ opam switch 4.11.1  # or "opam switch create 4.11.1" if you haven't got that switch already
$ eval $(opam env)
$ git clone https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/dune
$ cd dune  # We'll refer to this "dune" directory below as $DUNE_DIR
$ git checkout origin/special_dune
$ make release
```

You probably then want to fork the `ocaml-flambda/flambda-backend` repo to your own Github org.

## Branching and configuring

Use normal commands to make a branch from the main upstream branch (currently `4.11`), e.g.:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ocaml-flambda/flambda-backend
$ cd flambda-backend
$ git checkout -b myfeature origin/4.11
```

The Flambda backend tree has to be configured before building.  The configure script is not checked
in; you have to run `autoconf`.  For example:
```
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir --enable-middle-end=closure --with-dune=$DUNE_DIR/dune.exe
```
You can also specify `--enable-middle-end=flambda`.

## Building and installing

To build and install the Flambda backend, which produces a compiler installation directory whose
layout is compatible with upstream, run:
```
$ make  # or e.g. make -j16
$ make install
```

## Running tests

Prior to `make install` you can do:
- `make runtest` to run the Flambda backend tests (which use dune);
- `make runtest-upstream` to run the upstream testsuite. The upstream
testsuite runs much faster if you install GNU parallel. This is likely
already present on Linux machines. On macOS, install Homebrew, then `brew
install parallel`.
- `make compare` to run the comparison script that finds differences
between the upstream and Flambda backend install trees.  This script currently
only runs on Linux, although it shouldn't be hard to port to macOS, especially
if using GNU binutils.  It is recommended to install the Jane Street `patdiff` executable
before running `make compare`.

There is also a `make ci` target (best run as e.g. `make -j16 ci`) which does a full build
and test run.  It does not currently run `make compare` as some spurious failures have
been observed on the Github systems.
